// method is a group of statements grouped together to complete a task
// argument is whart you put in a call kinda like how you put a parameter in a header

Array stuff will be all in the NameFinder section.Feel free to make your street name :)
I don' have an array math section. I really should do that and I'll get onto it.
I also don't have a continue statement however I have many break statements and can explain a continue later in this read me. 
A continue statement causes the loop to go to it's next phase.

// inheritance is useful for not having to use extra ram and typing time on classes with
// similarities. ex. circle and sphere both have a radius
/*
 * In Java, we have eight primitive data types: boolean: true and false char: one character byte:

 * -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. float: value that holds 6 to 7 decimal
 * digits double: all numbers with decimal points up to 15 digits

// casting is changing the datatype from one type to another. i use it on line 22
// i use escape sequence on 19 (a shortcut for new line and tab and other stuff like that

// hi :)
the break statement allows you to leave a loop or switch
operator precedence is like PEMDAS but with extra steps for java.
